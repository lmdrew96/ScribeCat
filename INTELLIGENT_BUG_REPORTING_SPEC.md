# ScribeCat Intelligent Bug Reporting - Updated Specification

## Overview

The issue template has been completely rewritten to reflect a proactive, intelligent bug reporting system that prioritizes user experience while maintaining the zero-authentication approach.

## Key Changes Made

### ðŸŽ¯ **Streamlined UX Philosophy**
- **Automatic repository targeting**: Users never need to choose a repo - all reports go to `lmdrew96/ScribeCat`
- **Proactive error detection**: App monitors for internal errors and suggests bug reporting automatically
- **Minimal user effort**: Comprehensive reports generated with minimal user input required
- **Non-intrusive approach**: Error notifications are subtle and don't block user workflow

### ðŸ¤– **Enhanced AskAI Integration** 
- **Immersive conversation**: Bug reporting happens naturally within AskAI chat interface
- **Intelligent detection**: AskAI recognizes when users are experiencing bugs during feature discussions
- **Guided questioning**: AI asks 3-5 clear, plain-English questions to gather sufficient context
- **Seamless transitions**: From help request to bug detection to reporting without modal interruptions

### ðŸ“‹ **Smart Bug Report Generation**
- **Automatic context capture**: Session data, error logs, app state included automatically  
- **AI-powered analysis**: Comprehensive symptom analysis and reproduction steps
- **User review and approval**: Users always see and approve final report before submission
- **Intelligent pre-filling**: Reports contain developer-actionable information with minimal user effort

## User Experience Flows

### 1. Proactive Error Detection
```
App Error â†’ Non-intrusive notification â†’ Optional "Report Bug" â†’ 
Minimal user input â†’ Auto-generated comprehensive report â†’ Browser submission
```

### 2. Conversational Bug Reporting  
```
User asks AskAI about feature â†’ AI detects potential bug â†’ 
Offers to help report â†’ Guided Q&A â†’ AI generates report â†’ 
User approves â†’ Browser submission
```

### 3. Immersive Help with Bug Detection
```
User seeks help â†’ AskAI provides guidance â†’ 
If steps don't work â†’ AI suggests bug reporting â†’ 
Seamless transition to reporting flow
```

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Error Monitoring System**: Global handlers detect exceptions and failed operations
- **Smart Notification System**: Non-blocking popups with clear dismiss options  
- **AskAI Conversation Analysis**: AI recognizes bug-related discussions
- **Guided Interview System**: Structured Q&A flow for context gathering
- **Intelligent Report Generator**: Auto-populates comprehensive GitHub issues

### Privacy & Security
- **Zero Authentication**: No OAuth, API keys, or account setup
- **User Control**: All data inclusion requires explicit approval
