This scaffold provides a production-ready foundation for the ScribeCat iOS mobile companion app with clear paths for:
- Integration with the real ScribeCat desktop API
- App Store deployment and TestFlight distribution  
- CloudKit configuration and Apple Developer account setup
- Localization expansion to additional languages
- Feature enhancement and UI/UX improvements

### Notes for Maintainers

- The mock API can be easily replaced with real implementation by updating dependency injection
- CloudKit schema needs to be initialized in Apple Developer Console for production use
- Fastlane deployment requires Apple Developer account and proper secret configuration
- All user-facing strings are localized and ready for additional language support
- Power optimizations are implemented throughout with documented battery-saving recommendations
