### Implementation Plans for UX Enhancements and Full Offline Editor

This issue outlines implementation plans for several UX enhancements and the development of full offline editor functionality. Here are the details:

### 1. Interactive Tutorials
- **Objective:** Create a step-by-step guide for first-time users.
- **Implementation:**
  - Create an overlay with tooltips and highlighted sections for features like transcription, note-taking, and saving files.
  - Allow users to skip or revisit the tutorial from the settings menu.
  - Store tutorial progress using local storage.

### 2. Collaboration Tools
- **Objective:** Enable real-time collaborative note-taking.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use WebRTC or Firebase to synchronize transcription, notes, and audio recordings across users.
  - Add user roles (e.g., editor, viewer) for access control.
  - Provide a workspace ID or shared link for collaboration.

### 3. Advanced Audio Features
- **Objective:** Enhance audio recording quality.
- **Implementation:**
  - Integrate third-party libraries like SoX or Web Audio API for noise reduction and echo cancellation.
  - Add toggles in the settings for enabling/disabling these features.
  - Provide audio enhancement presets (e.g., "Podcast Mode").
  - Allow previewing audio adjustments before applying them.

### 4. Custom Shortcuts
- **Objective:** Allow users to define custom keybindings for frequent actions.
- **Implementation:**
  - Create a shortcut manager in the settings menu.
  - Allow users to assign key combinations for actions like toggling themes or starting a transcription.
  - Store shortcuts locally in a configuration file or database.
  - Include a "Reset to Default" option.

### 5. Integration with Cloud Storage
- **Objective:** Expand cloud storage support.
- **Implementation:**
  - Extend beyond Google Drive to include Dropbox and OneDrive.
  - Use respective APIs for authentication and file uploads.
  - Add an option to select the preferred cloud service.
  - Implement background auto-sync for seamless file saving.

### 6. Enhanced Accessibility
- **Objective:** Improve accessibility features.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use Web Speech API for text-to-speech functionality.
  - Add high-contrast themes and dynamic font size adjustments.
  - Ensure all app elements are keyboard-navigable.
  - Include ARIA roles for screen reader compatibility.

### 7. Mobile Companion App
- **Objective:** Develop a lightweight mobile app for note review and transcription.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use React Native or Flutter to build the app.
  - Focus on reviewing transcriptions, quick note-taking, and accessing cloud-synced files.
  - Provide offline access for downloaded files and notes.

### 8. Full Offline Editor Functionality
- **Objective:** Ensure complete functionality without an internet connection.
- **Implementation:**
  - Implement local storage for saving transcriptions, notes, and settings offline.
  - Add a "Synchronize" button for manually uploading offline work.
  - Enable all features (e.g., formatting, audio recording, transcription via Vosk) to work offline.
  - Display offline indicators in the UI to inform users about limited functionality.
  - Add robust error handling to prevent data loss during offline mode.

**Questions:**
1. Which of these features should be prioritized for development?
2. Are there additional details or requirements for any of these features?
3. Should these enhancements be implemented in separate milestones or as a single release?

Please provide your feedback and thoughts on this plan. Once finalized, we can begin assigning tasks and setting timelines.
